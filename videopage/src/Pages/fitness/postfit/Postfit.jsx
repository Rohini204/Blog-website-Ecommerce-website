            <center><b>Push-ups</b>: Start in a plank position with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows and then push back up.</center>
            <center><b>Planks</b>: Get into a push-up position and hold your body in a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core muscles and hold the position for as long as you can.</center></div><br></br>
